# Privacy Policy for AirBridge

Last Updated: 01-mar-2026

AirBridge ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in the AirBridge mobile application.

## 1. Information Collection and Use
**AirBridge does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.** 
The application functions as a local server (HTTP/FTP) to facilitate file transfers between your devices on the same Wi-Fi network. 

*   **Files:** We do not have access to your files. Files are only accessed by the local server to be served to other devices you connect via your local network.
*   **Permissions:** The app requests "All Files Access" (MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) solely to allow you to share selected folders from your device.

## 2. Third-Party Services
The app uses Google AdMob for monetization. AdMob may collect certain information to serve personalized or non-personalized advertisements, including:
*   IP address (for general location)
*   Advertising ID
*   Device information and performance data

For more information, please visit [Google's Privacy & Terms](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## 3. Data Security
Since data transfer occurs over your private local Wi-Fi network, the security of the transfer depends on your network's security. We provide optional username and password protection for the FTP/HTTP services to help you restrict access.

## 4. Children's Privacy
AirBridge does not knowingly collect any personal information from children.
